# Test Generation Guidelines 
-Write unit tests using Jest. 
-Each test method should be named using the pattern: 
should[DoSomething]When[Condition]. 
-Cover all public methods, including edge cases and error 
handling. 
-Use clear assertions and meaningful test data. 
-Prefer descriptive test method names that specify the scenario 
and expected outcome. 
-Include both positive and negative test cases, covering edge 
conditions. 
-Add comments to clarify the intent of complex test logic. 
-Validate not only the output but also side effects (such as state 
changes or exceptions). 
-Clean up any resources or data created during the test in 
teardown methods. 
-Use parameterized tests for repetitive logic with different input 
values. 
-Avoid hardcoding values that may change; use constants or 
builders where appropriate.
-Review and update tests regularly as the codebase evolves.
